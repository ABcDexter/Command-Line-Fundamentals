# Introduction-to-the-Command-Line
Code bundle for Introduction the the Command Line by Packt


Note:
Since we are not dealing with source code, but interactive commands, each exercise has a text file with the commands for each step which can be directly pasted into a bash shell to verify the results.

The exercises assume that the example user name is "robin", although this is not essential to their working.
Comments within the files are prefixed with #, so that there are no issues if they get pasted into the terminal by mistake.

We require that the user has created a folder called "Lesson1" and download the following files into it - these files contain test data that is used for Lesson 1 as well as future ones.

Lesson1_TopicA.zip
Lesson1_TopicC.zip


Additional data for future lessons will be added to the repository as the each lesson is developed
