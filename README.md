# Introduction-to-the-Command-Line
Code bundle for Introduction the the Command Line by Packt


Note:
Since we are not dealing with source code, but interactive commands, each exercise has a text file with the commands for each step which can be directly pasted into a bash shell to verify the results.

The exercises assume that the example user name is "robin", although this is not essential to their working.
Comments within the files are prefixed with " #", so that there are no issues if they get pasted into the terminal by mistake.
Please export HISTCONTROL=ignorespace so that the command history does not pick up any of the comments
History needs to be maintained verbatim for some of the exercises

Each lesson has its own zip file of data to be extracted in the home directory

An Open Virtualization Appliance (built for use with Virtualbox) containing a Porteus Linux distro is provided in the repository
The VM image already contains the sample data as well as the snippets that are here.
